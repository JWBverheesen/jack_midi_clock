FEATURE REQUESTS
================

   o Implement START/STOP/CONTINUE/LOCATE.  This is needed for
     completeness, and was also requested by Julien Claassen
     <julien@c-lab.de> on the LAU.
     STATUS: TO-DO
     (8/1/09, gabe)

   o When the JACK Transport stops, so do the MIDI Clock pulses.
     Would be nice if there was a feature to keep the pulses coming
     even if the transport is stopped.  (Use case: only using the JACK
     transport for its TEMPO information, like for the MS2000(R)).
     STATUS: TO-DO
     (8/1/09, gabe)

   o In process(), interval is calculated as a floating-point type and
     then rounded to an integer.  This will result in steady-state
     drifting.  Would be better if we dithered the rounding.
     STATUS: No.  See next.
     (8/1/09, gabe)

   o Right now, the clock pulses are free-rolling and do not
     necessarily snap to any beat.  Would be nice if they did.
     Note that this removes the need for dithering.
     STATUS: TO-DO
     (8/1/09, gabe)

   o Implement MIDI Time Clock (MTC).  Requested by Julien Claassen
     <julien@c-lab.de> (and possibly others) on the LAU.
     STATUS: Thinking about it.
