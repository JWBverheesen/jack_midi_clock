ABSTRACT
========

This program is a simple JACK client that sends out MIDI Clock pulses
based on the current tempo given by the JACK transport.

CODING CONVENTIONS
==================

I used to be an avid tabs guy... convinced by Linus Torvalds.
However, while tabs is great for C code, it's not so great for C++
code.  With namespaces, classes, try/catch blocks... it's not uncommon
to have 4 levels of indention (1/3 of the screen) before you even
DECLARE your function... much less code it.

Therefore, I prefer the emacs Stroustrup (modified K&R) mode with no
tabs.  Indents should be 4 spaces.
