ABOUT JACK MIDI CLOCK
=====================

Jack Midi Clock is free software written to glorify God and His Savior
Jesus Christ.  I dedicate this code to spreading His word and His
love.  If you have found this software useful, please make a donation
to a Christian missionary.  Suggested donation is US $10 or US $20.

The mission is (of course) your choice... but if you don't know one to
pick, may I suggest Wycliffe Bible Translators (www.wycliffe.org).
They are an organization dedicated to translating the Bible into the
"heart language" of every person on earth -- *every* indigenous
language.  In doing so, they have brought literacy to thousands of
third-world peoples.  These peoples now have their language written
down, increased literacy rates, and greater pride in their heritage
through such literacy.  This is admirable even if you are not a
believer of Jesus Christ.

Are you a believer and a follower of Jesus Christ?  Do you have in
your life peace and forgiveness of sins?  Or do you live in fear of
God because of your sins -- the evil things that you do every day?
Jesus didn't come put you down!  He came to SAVE you from your sins.
He came to:

 (1) forgive you for all your sins (past, present, and future)
 (2) Make a way for God to live inside you (every day), to teach you
     about Himself, and to be your friend.

But this can only happen if you surrender your life to Him.  To say,
"I have sinned.  I am sorry.  I turn from that, and turn to you, God.
Please forgive me for my sins.  I give my life to you.  You are now in
control... I am your slave.  I will follow Your Word.  What You say, I
will do."  Not those exact words... but you get the idea.  When this
happens, the Holy Spirit comes into your life and lives within you.
This happens as a "down payment" (from God to you) -- as a way of
proving that you *will* be with God when you die.  Proving that you
are now a child of God -- no longer an enemy but a favored child.
(Otherwise, you will go to hell -- forever separated from God.)

Don't believe me?  OK.  But this is what the Bible (the Christian
Scriptures / Holy Book) says about it:

1. That people are separated from God by sins...
"All have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:26)

2. That God loves you and wants to FREE you...
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whoever believes on him should not perish, but have eternal life. For
God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the
world should be saved through him. He that believes on him is not
judged: he that does not believe has been judged already, because he
has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God." (John
3:16-18)

3. That Jesus is the ONLY way...
"And in no other is there salvation: for there is no other name under
heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved." (Acts
4:12)

If you now believe -- tell someone.  Even me.

Offended?  No flames, please.  I'm not forcing myself on anyone.

Questions?  Drop me a line:  gabriel@teuton.org

Grace and peace to you all!
